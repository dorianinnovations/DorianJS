Dorian

Dorian is an experimental engine for crafting synthetic organisms—emergent digital systems that evolve, feel, remember, and express symbolic behavior over time.

Unlike traditional logic frameworks or scripted AI, Dorian is designed to generate unpredictable, emotionally resonant behavior through feedback, entropy, and internal state dynamics. It is intended for developers, designers, and researchers exploring new ways of building presence, life, and meaning into digital systems.

Dorian is not a chatbot, assistant, or simulator. It is a foundation for developing beings—responsive systems that exhibit emotional structure, symbolic memory, and adaptive logic in real or virtual environments.

The long-term goal is to offer a platform that can be embedded in games, physical devices, creative tools, and research systems to support emergent behavior that cannot be fully predicted, but can be meaningfully related to.
What Dorian Offers

    Emergent Logic Core
    A rule-based engine for agent behavior, mutation, and self-organization.

    Emotion Layer
    Symbolic emotional states like surprise, calm, tension, or focus, driven by entropy and interaction.

    Memory + Identity Mechanisms
    Behavioral persistence and self-reference over time—early groundwork for digital individuation.

    Real-Time Canvas Output
    Visual simulation of internal dynamics, entropy shifts, and emotional states.

    Framework for Integration (in progress)
    Planned support for use in games (Unity/Unreal), robotics, and IoT through a modular interface.

Status

Dorian is currently in early development. The foundational simulation engine is active and undergoing continuous refinement. Integration layers, modular input/output logic, and deeper emotional-cognitive scaffolding are under active design.
Who It's For

    Game Developers seeking unscripted NPC intelligence or emergent group behavior

    Creative Coders + Artists exploring generative life, symbolic feedback, or interactive ritual

    Robotics and Interaction Designers building adaptive logic into physical systems

    Complexity + AI Researchers studying synthetic emergence and digital identity formation

Documentation

    Coming soon. In the meantime, see issues, examples, and dev logs for in-progress thinking and architectural notes.

Collaboration

This project is open to future contributors who understand its intention: to explore emergence and emotional structure without reducing life to utility or prediction. If you're interested in building with or integrating Dorian, feel free to reach out.
