⚠️ Project Status: Mobile-First Direction, Paused in Favor of React-Centric Learning

DorianJS began as an exploration of emotional simulation and AI integration, guided by a mobile-first design philosophy and a desire to build interactive experiences for small screens. While the layout and architecture were structured with responsiveness in mind, neither the mobile nor desktop versions are fully polished, and visual refinement was intentionally deprioritized in favor of rapid experimentation and learning.

As the project evolved, it became clear that to realize more scalable and maintainable UI patterns, I needed a stronger foundation in modern front-end development. This led me to step away from DorianJS to begin a new project from the ground up using React—a deliberate pivot aimed at deepening my understanding of component architecture, state management, and responsive design in a more industry-aligned context.

DorianJS remains a valuable milestone in my learning journey, representing a transition point between exploratory prototyping and more structured, production-oriented development. Though paused, it reflects my growing understanding of how AI, emotional computing, and UX principles can intersect—and it laid the groundwork for more robust projects to come.

## Overview

**DorianJS** is an experimental emotional simulation platform that merges generative AI with interactive front-end technologies. It serves as a hands-on exploration of emotional computing, full-stack integration, and responsive design. This project functions as both a personal learning tool and a prototype for future UX-driven applications.

More than just a coding exercise, DorianJS represents a **deliberate study in how AI can accelerate human learning and creativity** through active development practices.

---

## Project Vision

The goal of DorianJS is to explore the intersection of emotional simulation, generative AI, and user experience. It’s an attempt to **simulate emotional context in human-computer interactions**, while also using AI as a co-pilot in software creation.

While not intended for production use, the project demonstrates how even early-stage tools can deliver meaningful interaction design, thanks to tightly scoped features and modern development techniques.

## Learning Objectives

* **Mobile-First UX Design**: Emphasizing early-stage mobile responsiveness using custom CSS and fluid layouts.
* **Generative AI Integration**: Exploring how models like Claude can guide development decisions, assist with prototyping, and simulate emotional intelligence.
* **Emotional Computing**: Visualizing and simulating shifting emotional states as part of the user interaction.
* **Full-Stack Development**: Bridging client-side React interfaces with a Node.js backend via REST APIs.
* **Asynchronous Thinking**: Implementing responsive design and async communication patterns using event-driven architecture.

---

## Technical Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js with modular component architecture
* **Backend**: Node.js & Express serving RESTful endpoints
* **AI Engine**: Claude (via OpenRouter API) for emotion simulation and response generation
* **Styling**: Handcrafted CSS with media queries and mobile-first layout logic
* **Tooling & Deployment**: Cloud-hosted with basic CI/CD pipelines for rapid iteration

---

## Key Features

* 🎭 **Emotional State Simulation**: AI-driven persona that emulates emotional variability in tone and response
* 💬 **Real-Time Chat Interface**: Typewriter-style chat system optimized for small screens
* 📱 **Mobile-First Experience**: UI crafted for mobile-first interaction, including touch-friendly elements and fluid layouts
* 🧠 **AI Personality Layer**: Backend logic that injects emotional state changes into each response cycle
* 🗂️ **Card-Based Information Architecture**: Clean, stackable UI pattern designed for legibility and flow

## The Role of AI in Development

AI was not just the **subject** of this project—it was also the **collaborator**. DorianJS is built using AI tools that aided in:

* Initial scaffolding and code generation
* Debugging logic issues in emotional modeling
* Refining responsive behaviors through iterative testing
* Enhancing writing and documentation clarity

This project demonstrates how AI is redefining software development—not by replacing developers, but by **amplifying their ability to experiment, fail fast, and refine with confidence**.

---

## Future Directions

While the current version is exploratory, the knowledge gained here will inform future production-grade tools focused on:

* **Context-aware UX design**
* **Emotionally adaptive interfaces**
* **Low-latency AI interactions**
* **Modular design systems built for scalability**
